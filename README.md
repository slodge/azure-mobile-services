# Windows Azure Mobile Services - Mvvm Cross Platform Demo

This repo contains a quick MonoTouch and MonoDroid Mvvm sample that was built for a SixStepsToAzure demo.

The solution to use for the demo is the one in: /Samples/TODO/Android/Sample.sln

To get this code to build you will need to:
- build this alongside a folder containing mvvmCross vNext - from http://github.com/slodge/mvvmcross
- include some url and key info for your mobile service - see the PlatformSpecificService files - #error messages are included.

There are no instructions here currently about how to set up the server side script for this - sorry! 

@azureCoder or @slodge may blog about this at some future point... we may also build in more functionality - authentication, push, etc

A little more info is on slide 36 in: https://speakerdeck.com/cirrious/c-number-client-to-cloud?slide=36 - but only a little
